# VT Interactive Map Template

The purpose of the repository is to create a simple, interactive map showing the state of Vermont. The site rendering is responsive to screen sizes and mobile-friendly.  Categorized points of interest are populated by a simple .csv datafile.  It can be used to create custom resource maps.  The default polygon shapefile included uses town polygons, but can be changed to support any other WGS84 CRS geojson file including Counties, Watersheds, Zipcodes, etc.  The included tileset is provided by the United States Geological Survey, but can also be changed.

All included libraries are open-source and free.
